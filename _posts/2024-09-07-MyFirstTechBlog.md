I am a Fullstack Software Engineer entering my 9th year in the Naver search department. (South Korea)

This blog is a space where I want to share various stories from my career as an IT developer,

including experiences with technology, interviews, company life, and projects.

I hope that one of the posts I casually write will be valuable knowledge and experience for someone.

Let's keep it going consistently.
